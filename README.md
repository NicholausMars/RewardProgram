This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Reward Program
Simple application build to just calculate the total of transactions and rewards receive by each individual transaction from customer for the last three months. 
The information said that it receive data from the last three months place a data feature just in case it require data to be pass to the front end.
 There was no need to have a stateful component in this application so i just created functional component to receive the data from the user.
 One component for the List and the other component for the Items.
